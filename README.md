### My most recent dev activities:

- I am a 2x [Turbine3](https://turbin3.com/) cohort graduate:
  - Solana Builder's Q2 2024 cohort
    - Built and shipped (devnet) [Over / Under](https://over-under-beta.vercel.app/), a round-based, multiplayer betting game. Under further development.
    - Anchor program + NextJS front end
  - CosmWasm Q1 2023
    - Shipped 3x contracts, 1 token, and a Juno ecosystem contribution

- [BocaLibre](https://github.com/bgoober/BocaLibre) - An agent-based, peer-to-peer, chat/social messaging application, intended for users that speak differing native languages. Built atop Fetch.ai's uAgents framework and t5-base integration. The second thing I have built using Fetch'ai's stack; I heard Zuck is interested in buying it (just kidding).

- [Viceroy](https://github.com/bgoober/Viceroy) - An agent-based reader view plugin for summarizing an article or web page, using Fetch.ai's uAgents framework and the t5-base integration. The first thing I have built using Fetch'ai's stack, which I find intriguing.

- [Disburser](https://github.com/bgoober/Disburser) - Built to handle the disbursement of an application's fee revenues to a team of Owners based on their ownership percentage. I built this to accompany the main contract I developed for this cohort.

- [Muglies](https://github.com/bgoober/Muglies) - Just some ugly mugs I drew.

I have previous Product Owner and developer/analyst experience in consumer-facing GIS mapping applications, for web and mobile.
