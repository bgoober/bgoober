- Checkout [pet that dog!](https://pet-that-dog.vercel.app/)
  - I don't have a dog and sometimes I want to pet a dog, so I built this instead. Now you can pet a dog too!
  - If you show him love he will show you love back!
  - This is my main focus right now. If you like it and are interested in collaborating, contributing, or taking it to the next level with me then reach out!

- [BocaLibre](https://github.com/bgoober/BocaLibre) - An agent-based, peer-to-peer, chat/social messaging application, intended for users that speak differing native languages. Built atop Fetch.ai's uAgents framework and t5-base integration. The second thing I have built using Fetch'ai's stack; I heard Zuck is interested in buying it (just kidding).

- [Viceroy](https://github.com/bgoober/Viceroy) - An agent-based reader view plugin for summarizing an article or web page, using Fetch.ai's uAgents framework and the t5-base integration. The first thing I have built using Fetch'ai's stack, which I find intriguing.

- [Disburser](https://github.com/bgoober/Disburser) - Built to handle the disbursement of an application's fee revenues to a team of Owners based on their ownership percentage. I built this to accompany the main contract I developed for this cohort.

- [Muglies](https://github.com/bgoober/Muglies) - Just some ugly mugs I drew.

I have previous Product Owner and developer/analyst experience in consumer-facing GIS mapping applications, for web and mobile.
