I am an entrepreneur and Solana smart-contract and front-end application software developer. &#128187; &#128104;

&#x1F6F8; I am a Certified Part 107 Commercial Drone Pilot, and am currently developing my drone services business and skills. I have previous GIS and Product Owner/Manager experience that I am currently revitalizing and honing into a valuable career path forward. I have a lot of interest in mapping, inspections, disaster response, and ecological surveys. I love the outdoors, native species, and hunting, so I hope to make use of those interests and skills.

Some of my recent accomplishments:

1. I am the Co-Founder, Chief Technology Officer, Head of Product, and Lead Engineer/Lead Developer of GotSOL -- A Merchant Point of Sale, Inventory Management System, and Bookeeping product, Built on Solana. [GotSOLpay.com](https://gotsolpay.com/)

2. I built the entire Anchor program/contract back-end and its business logic. 

3. I designed and built the majority of the front-end application as well.

4. In ~6-8 months I built and launched a fully on-chain business built for Merchants to expand their Point of Sale payment rails to Solana stablecoins, and manage their Inventory and Bookkeeping.

5. I know what its like to run a startup and handle almost every role therein, as well as participate and be at the head of entrepreneurial product development.

While this is my main GitHub account, my other GitHub account, which was used to build the majority of GotSOL, can be found here: [gotsol-dev](https://github.com/gotsol-dev)

Previously, I built a dog-themed Solana token launchpad and interactive application called _pet that dog!_ which you can interact with here: [pet that dog!](https://pet-that-dog.vercel.app/) It's a fun, interactive on-chain program and front-end application that allows you to interact with a "dog", and when you do the dog will mint you one of its tokens each time. It is a full on-chain program that I built from the ground up. I also worked on the artwork myself, though I am not the only artist who did. I may return to this project one day, if it makes sense to do so, and a clear product is envisioned.
